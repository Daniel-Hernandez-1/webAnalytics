# webAnalytics
Analytics of web broswer history. This code fully implements all     options and requirements as stated in the Project2.pdf file for this     assignment. The program uses a logins.txt file to keep track of user login     credentials and also writes to this file when new users register. Each user     is assigned a &lt;username>.txt file, where &lt;username> is the actual username     of the user, at the time they begin to enter websites. The text file will     contain all the websites the user enters and is used in options 4 - 7 to     perform the required operations.
